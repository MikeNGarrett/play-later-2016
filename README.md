# Play Later 2016
Database of all new music releases tracked in 2016 on http://play-later.com/

## Play Later
Play Later is a service to dig through the new release bin every Friday to find all those albums and singles you love. If you use Spotify, you can connect your account to store all these new finds in a playlist called "Play Later."

Inspired by Rdio's New Release functionality. 

## The Data
The CSV contains album name, release date, availability, popularity (out of 100, sourced from Spotify and Last.fm), number of tracks, album artwork, artist images (if available), artist information (from Spotify), genre information (if available), and single/album designation.
